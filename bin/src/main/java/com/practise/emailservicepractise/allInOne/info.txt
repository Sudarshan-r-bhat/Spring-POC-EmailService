--------------------
Problem statement:
	. This is a dummy User Registration.
	. so when you receive a user object from the controller, it is validated 
	 in chains. 
	. in the final chain (after validation is successful) database gets a user entry.
	. also, a verification email is sent to the user's email after registration is successful.
	
	

FLow OF THE DESIGN:
---------------------
EmailProcessor is an Abstract class

chain 1, 2, 3 extend the abstract class.

EmailChainCreator will set up the chains, make the chain accessible through
a method.

The above provided method will be used in the @Service to create chain. And
to pass the request to the chains.

......................   NOTES   ...................................
. I had encountered Cyclic dependency issue, when i created a JavaMailSender @bean,
 so had to remove that, simply use @Autowired.
 i guess, JavaMailSender is already beaned out. that is why i encountered this error.


. I had made a mistake of Autowiring the current class inside itself. which causes a problem of
 creation of 2 beans of the same type and same bean name. IDK how ?
